### running all tests

tests can be executed as a test suite by entering the following commands:

`chmod +x runalltests.sh`
`./runalltests.sh` in your bash or .zshrc shell.

to run tests indivdually, just use for example 
`pytest test_login.py` or some other file name.

update test files with your credentials.
e.g. `test_login.py`
